# Lighthouse audits
Below is the initial Lighthouse audit. The initial performance and SEO scores were low. For performance, Lighthouse said I did not have a width description on the logo on the front page. I also forgot to add a meta description and keywords, which brought my SEO down.

After I added the SEO search terms and completed the audit in a separate Chrome tag, the scores improved.
